# Fusion-Dex
This is a Pokedex for Pokemon Infinite Fusion which lets you filter out and sort Pokemon.

fusionDex.csv contains the informal Pokedex number used by players of Pokemon Fusion (HeadDexNumber-BodyDexNumber), the head Pokemon's name, the body Pokemon's name, the typing, the base stat total, the individual stats, the abilities, and the weight of every possible Pokemon Fusion (except the few triple-fusions).

fusionSorter.py opens a GUI that allows the user to place filters on the data and change the order in which the data is displayed.
